# ASC main Makefile.
#
# This is meant to be a "hub" including other *.mk files. It also attempts to
# load all the globals aggregated during instance init.
# @see asc/env/current/README.md
#
# It provides the following tasks out of the box for all project instances :
# - [default] 'init': the 1st common step necessary to actually make ASC & its
#   extensions useful;
# - 'hook-call', a convenience wrapper to ASC hook() calls;
# - 'hook-debug', the same except it will just print out the lookup paths.
#   Useful for looking up positive matches to then provide overrides and/or
#   complements;
# - 'globals-lp', to show every globals lookup paths checked for aggregation
#   during instance init for current project instance.
#
# @example
#   # Initialize current project instance = trigger "instance init" :
#   make
#   make init # <- Alternative call (the 'init' task is the default).
#
#   # Print lookup paths used for globals aggregation during instance init.
#   make globals-lp
#
#   # Print lookup paths for the ASC hook call :
#   # hook -s 'instance' -a 'stop' -v 'PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE'
#   make hook-debug s:instance a:stop v:PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE
#
#   # Print result of the "most specific" hook call variant :
#   make hook-debug ms s:instance a:stop v:PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE
#
#   # Trigger "instance start" manually :
#   make hook-call s:instance a:start
#
#   # Print lookup paths for "instance start" using PROVISION_USING variant :
#   make hook-debug s:instance a:start v:PROVISION_USING
#   # Same but using more variants :
#   make hook-debug s:instance a:start v:PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE INSTANCE_TYPE
