# [abstract] Gets host-level registry value.
#
# Reads from an abstract host-level storage by given key. "Abstract" means that
# ASC core itself doesn't provide any actual implementation for this
# functionality. It is necessary to use an extension which does. E.g. :
# @see asc/extensions/file_registry
#
# @example
#   asc/host/registry_get.sh my_key
#

. asc/bootstrap.sh
u_host_registry_get "$@"
echo "$reg_val"
