# ASC core global env vars.
#
# This file (and every others named like it in ASC extensions and in the ASC
# customization dir) is used during "instance init" to generate a single script :
#
# $PROJECT_ASC_SCRIPTS/local/global.vars.sh
#
# That script file will contain declarations for every global variables found in
# this project instance as readonly. It is git-ignored and loaded on every
# bootstrap - if it exists, that is if "instance init" was already launched once
# in current project instance.
#
# Unless the "instance init" command is set to bypass prompts, most calls to
# global() will prompt for confirming or replacing default values or for simply
# entering a value if no default is declared. The only exceptions are global
# declarations explicitly providing a value.
