# ASC remote instance *setup* action.

# Starts by running the remote instance *init* action, then :
#   - starts services (if any are implemented),
#   - executes the app install action (if any operations are implemented).
#
# @param 1 String : remote instance ID.
# @param ... all the memaining params are forwarded to asc/instance/init.sh (but
#   the host type is preset to 'remote')
#
# @example
#   # Sets up a new LAN instance of type 'prod' without interactive terminal
#   # prompts, overriding the host type to 'local' (to avoid being assigned
#   # the 'prod remote' INSTANCE_DOMAIN when we're using the local YAML settings
#   # overrides - i.e. scripts/asc/override/.asc-local.remote.prod.yml):
#   asc/extensions/remote/remote/setup.sh 'lan' -t 'prod' -h 'local'
