# [abstract] Deletes all traces of this project instance on current host.
#
# This script provides an entry point for triggering a specific hook. "Abstract"
# means that ASC core itself doesn't provide any actual implementation for this
# functionality. In order for this script to have any effect, it is necessary
# to use an extension that does.
#
# To list all the possible paths that can be used - among which existing files
# will be sourced when the hook is triggered, use :
# $ make hook-debug s:instance a:destroy v:PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE INSTANCE_TYPE
#
# @example
#   make destroy
#   # Or :
#   asc/instance/destroy.sh
#

. asc/bootstrap.sh

hook -s 'instance' -a 'destroy' -v 'PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE INSTANCE_TYPE'
