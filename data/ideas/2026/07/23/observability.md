The addition of new implementations should be done in sync with their own "ideal" representation as cwt presets.

Update the plan to include that in its scope.

Now, does it make sense to have the default cwt core to have out-of-the-box something implementing its own hooks (like gpu and log storage) serving as an overridable default for debian hosts that :

- by default, monitor all host-level threads (opt-in behaviour from the thread subject) via crontab (overridable default, must be easily switched via a dedicated prefixed env var) so that any CWT instance (nested or not) can know about their respective siblings (if they're running already, etc).  
- offer instance-level loop monitoring (what is running, is stale, finished...)

that default cwt observability / monitoring needs a global off switch.

The plan also needs to include new living documentation files to be created at docs/[observability.md](http://observability.md) and docs/[monitoring.md](http://monitoring.md)
